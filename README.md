Care For Yourself to Care for Others

This collage is a PSA of sorts, presenting an engaging art piece that gives information for those seeking mental health help. The image features 2 hands, one at the top left corner and the other at the bottom right. The bottom right hand is shrouded in smoke, whereas the top left hand has a soft pink light emanating from it. The hands can be seen exchanging money, a heart, and a clock, all representing things that are given and sacrificed during a relationship: finances, time, and affection. 

The main text that is featured is the quote, "Giving from a place of emptiness only leads to resentment". The word resentment is the main focus since it is the most emotionally charged word in the quote. At the bottom left, there is a number to the National Alliance on Mental Illness hotline for those who connect with the piece.
