Many new features are present in the draft that were not part of the preview. First, the draft has a whole new and improved background that much better suites the mood of the piece. Furthermore, the text has been stylized and revamped to look much more appealing, as well as has the additional hotline information.

Visual components have also been added, with smoke at the base of the bottom hand, and a lens flare behind the top hand. Furthermore, dollar bills have been added to the piece.
